# Platformer Prototypes
Various prototypes for 2D platformers, including:

## Fishdrop
Fast-paced 2D platformer focused on momentum and simple controls (just one button!).

### Controls
- Move with ARROW KEYS.
- Hold SPACE to crouch (SPACE while moving to slide), then let go to jump.
- Hold SPACE while airborne to drop down.

## Dash Counter
Even faster-paced 2D platformer, this time with a horizontal dash.

### Controls
- Move with WASD
- Jump with J
- Dash with K

Vertical momentum is conserved while dashing.
